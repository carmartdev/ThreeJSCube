# Accessible 3D Cube using Three.js

This is an example of creating an accessible web page where a 3D cube with applied texture is rendered using Three.js. The cube spins slowly in both x and y dimensions.

The HTML portion contains an instructional div element and a container div, where the 3D object will be rendered.

Aria roles and labels are included to make the page more accessible.
